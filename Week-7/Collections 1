def final_position(pos: tuple, vel: tuple, time: int) -> tuple:
    '''
    Given an initial position of a point moving in a cartesian plane with a constant velocity, 
    find the the final position of the point after a given time. 
    
    Args:
        pos - tuple[int]: A tuple representing the position vector (x1, y1).
        vel - tuple[int]: A tuple representing the velocity vector (vx, vy).
        time - int: time of movement.

    Returns:
        tuple[int]: A tuple representing the final position (x, y).
    '''
    x1, y1 = pos

    # Calculate new position
    x_final = x1 + vx * time
    y_final = y1 + vy * time
