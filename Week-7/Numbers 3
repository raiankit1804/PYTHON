def manhattan_distance_via_b(a: tuple, b: tuple, c: tuple) -> int:
    '''
    Given three points a, b, and c on the Cartesian plane, 
    calculate the Manhattan distance to go from point a to point c via point b.

    Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates.

    Args:
        a (tuple): Coordinates of point a as (x1, y1).
        b (tuple): Coordinates of point b as (x2, y2).
        c (tuple): Coordinates of point c as (x3, y3).

    Returns:
        int: The Manhattan distance from point a to point c via point b.
    '''
    ax, ay = a
    bx, by = b
    cx, cy = c

    # Distance from a to b
    dist_ab = abs(bx - ax) + abs(by - ay)

    # Distance from b to c
    dist_bc = abs(cx - bx) + abs(cy - by)

    # Total distance via b
    return dist_ab + dist_bc
